# Electronics-Projects
## Overview
This Repository contains several different electronics projects.  It consists of electronic circuit diagrams, parts lists, instructions and additional information.
The Projects are organized by Skill Level at the top, then a sub-catagory and then individual project folders containing all the resources.

## Structure
Each Project folder contains a Readme with the same title as the project with important details.  Sub-catagories may or may not have a readme and common information to avoid unnessicary redundant information. There will also be circuit diagrams of **new** components detailed in the sub-catagory if applicable.

## Disclaimer
These projects are meant to be **supplimental applied information**.  It is **not** a replacement for the theoretical background, formal instruction or formal educational resources. Most of the information is limited to the scope of the projects and information nessciary to understand the documentation.  Going beyond the scope of any project without understanding the theoretical background is not advised.
