# Tools and Skills
Beyond the theoretical concepts and equations there are some essential skills and tools every electrical engineer needs.

## Tools
  Every electrical engineer should have a multi-meter, a solderless protoyping board (aka a breadboard) a soldering iron, pencil, paper and a calaculator.
 
 ## Skills
  All electrical engineers should know how to solder, use a breadboard, tin wires, and know how to use a multi-meter properly.  A mathamatical background of at least Calculus II is reccomended.
