#Theoretical Background
Before diving headlong into projects, it's important to understand the math as well as the relevant physical processes that are going on in a circuit. The theoretical background comes in the forms of equations.  The Key equations are Ohm's Laws, Kirchov's Laws, equations governing Inductors and Capactitors as well as complex circuit analysis.  All of these can be found easily online with a simple search.  All that is here is what those equations actually manifest themselves.  

First Ohm's Laws.  It's all about the proportional relationship of Current (I), Voltage (V) and Resistance (R).  These govern the basic circuit, without voltage there is no current, even if there is resistance.  None can be 0 for a complete circuit.  However it is limited to a single component.

Kirchov's laws are based off of Ohm's laws.  There is Kirchov's Voltage rule, in which all voltages across each component that is not a source is equal to the voltage source. A consequence of the first rule is that the net current in any single junction is 0. 

Kirchov's laws describe entire circuits.  But out of all the circuits ever created they can be catagorized into 3 types. Series, Parallel and Complex.  Complex is just a combination of series and parallel circuits with multiple voltage/current sources. Complex circuits will be covered later.  Enjoy.

Series circuits have the same current among components, but voltage differs.  If you put two AA batteries in series, they provide ~3 Volts. Individually they have 1.5V each. Since they are in series the current is the same.

Parallel circits all have the same voltage across each seperate line, but different currents depending on what each line needs.
