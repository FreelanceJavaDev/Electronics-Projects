# Clever use of Components
There are some tricks that very few electrical enginneers think of.  These tricks aren't taught in any electrical engineering courses or in any text book I've ever read.

## The Humble incandescent lightbulb
  An incandescent lightbulb has many desireable qualities in certain circuits.  For one it is a high watt, low resistance thermo-resistor that's cheap and easy to find.

## Water? NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
  Water + Expensive electronics = very bad day (or a very bad week).  At a bare minimum you'll need a large plastic container, a LOT of 90% or higher rubbing alchol patience, and luck.  If by chance the damage is salt water rinse off the board with distilled water before proceeding.  Sounds crazy to pour more water on electronics that have had water. But that salt will leave a real mess afterwards that will take much longer to remove and will cause additional damage in the meantime.  The process is simple, place the board in a pool of rubbing alchol just deep enough to cover the components. Let the rubbing alchol evaporate and take some water with it and repeat until it's bone dry.
