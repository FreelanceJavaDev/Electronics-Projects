# Inverting Op-amp
While the comparator is the core of how an op-amp functions. It is not an op-amp on it's own.  An Op-amp has three different connections.  The inverting input (-), non-inverting input and output (+).  It also requires a seperate power and ground connection, but those are typically omitted.
