# The Comparator, the basic core of every Operational Amplfier.
A lot of fun can be made with a handful of transistors and a few other components.  But with enough transistors organized in a particualr configuration the possibilities become even greater.  Transistors are all that makes a computer function, there's a bit more to it than that, but the basic concept is sound.  However before building a computer with nothing but transistors, a simpler circuit to construct is the Operational Amplifier, or Op-Amp. 

At the very core of an Op-Amp is a circuit called a comparator, which compares to inputs and spits out the difference in the two outputs.
