# A Simple Solar powered Light
## The Simple Solar Light is a very simple introduction to the use of transistors.
Transitors act as a sort of automatic switch.  They are extremely helpful in automating switchover tasks. Credit to the idea of this circuit is goes to evilmadscientist.com and their simple solar circuit article.

## Transistor Basics
All basic transitors have three pins, the Collector, Base and Emitter (abbrivated C, B and E).Before beginning there are two types of basic transitors, Negative-Positive-Negative (NPN) and Positive-Negative-Postive (PNP).  They are differentiated by thier schematic symbol (See Transistor Symbols).  

Transistors also increase the current (called gain) which is typically 100 or 200 times the collector current. This particular application doesn't do much.  They can also blow out (literally) so make sure the Collector and Base current less than than the maximum rating.

## Project basics
The clearest method to demonstrate it is using transistors to switch from one power source to another, such as switching from a solar panel to battery power when it gets dark outside.  It would also be nice if the light was off during the day.  This simple project does both. It might seem a bit TOO simple at first and seem a strange layout.

## Parts
  - 1 Solar Panel 4V or 6V @ 150mA
  - 2 1.2V, 1800mAh AA rechargable Ni-MH batteries.
  - 1 PNP transistor
  - 1 5k-ohm resistor (5.1k-ohm is also acceptable)
  - 1 Diode
  - 1 100 ohm (or 150 ohm) resistor
  - 1 Red LED (or Yelllow)
  - 1 2x AA battery holder (Optional but reccomended)

### LIMITATIONS
  The circuit detailed here cannot light up White LEDs as they require 3V.  There is a different version that has no such limitation that is covered later.  This is merely to introduce transistors to those unfamiliar with their operation. 
  
  This particular project utilizes rechargable batteries, specifically Nickel-Metal-Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries.  DO NOT USE LITHIUM ION BATTERIES!  
  
  Also the Solar panel should have a maximum current rating of less than 1/10 of the capacity of the batteries (IE if they are 1300mAh only get a solar panel that has a current rating of 120mA or less)
